## 1. Introduction

ArduRover is a GPS-enabled smart rover based on the Arduino hardware platform. This project served as a way to explore robotics, electronics, and software-for-hardware topics in a fun and accessible manner. As a Computer Science major at Pomona College, I have had plenty of classroom and real-world opportunities to explore software and its applications, but students are not as frequently exposed to hardware problems. This project was a personal attempt to fill that void while also focusing on topics that interest me.

This project's status was documented with bi-weekly [reports](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/tree/main/reports) over the course of the Fall 2022 semester, and this writeup serves as a final, extended report before the semester draws to a close.
