## 1. Introduction

 As a Computer Science major at Pomona College, I have had plenty of classroom and real-world opportunities to explore software and its applications. However, I have not been nearly as exposed to interesting hardware problems throughout my education. This project was a personal attempt to fill that void while also focusing on topics that interest me. As a result, I decided to pursue a rover robotics project: ArduRover. 
 
 ArduRover is a GPS-enabled smart rover based on the Arduino hardware platform. This project served as a way to explore robotics, electronics, and software-for-hardware topics in a fun and accessible manner. This project's status was documented with bi-weekly [reports](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/tree/main/reports) over the course of the Fall 2022 semester, and this writeup serves as a final, extended report before the semester draws to a close.

## 2. Related Works and Projects

 Before diving headfirst into acquiring parts and learning the basics of electronics, I first brushed up on similar projects and related works taken on by others. Listed below are a few papers and projects I read through and my notes are linked [here](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/blob/main/literature/ArduRoverSourcesNotes.pdf).

 These related works and projects definitely streamlined the development and testing process for me, and their relevant contributions (especially for the projects) have been called out in current [code snippets](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/tree/main/code/DemoCode).

## 3. Project Goals

 After getting a better feel for what work had *already* been done in this space, I felt comfortable setting some project goals for myself while working on ArduRover. I split the goals into two groups, functional and personal, so that I could look back at the end of the semester and see what I was able to achieve in both areas.

#### 3a. Functional Goals
 - Create a parts list of interopable components compass unit, GPS receiver, motor controller, etc.
 - Assemble a fully-functional (can drive, turn, etc.) robotic car chassis 
 - Control car motors with an Arduino microcontroller
 - Enable autonomous driving capabilities with GPS + compass data

#### 3b. Personal Goals
 - Develop and stick achievable milestone deadlines
 - Learn how to navigate open-source hardware docs 
 - Learn how to write software for hardware
 - Gain basic hardware engineering skills (soldering, wiring, etc.)
 - Work with Prof. Clark since this is his area of expertise!

## 4. Project Status

#### 4a. Current Status

 Currently, ArduRover rolls! The car chassis is based on a small, cheap RC car from Amazon that was gutted to replace RC control systems with an Arduino, new motor controller, etc. (see [10/03](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/blob/main/reports/10-03-2022/10-03-2022.md) and [10/21](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/blob/main/reports/10-21-2022/10-21-2022.md) reports for more on parts used). These components can communicate effectively and the software that drives them can successfully pilot the car along a predetermined path (see [video](https://youtu.be/Pe0to9lpWN0)).

 The current platform powers the motor controller/motors on the same 3.6 volt battery that came with the original RC car and powers the Arduino, GPS shield, and compass with a separate rechargeable 9 volt battery. In terms of located key components, the motor controller and relevant wiring is located below the component platform. Additionally, the compass is located on the front of the vehicle and the GPS unit is located in the center stacked on top of the Arduino. Similar to Elon Musk's promises about "Full Self Driving" on Tesla vehicles, this rover includes all of the necessary hardware for autonomous GPS navigation and is just missing the required software to take advantage of the hardware. Hopefully, unlike Elon, I'll be able to get ArduRover's software in order in a reasonable amount of time. :)

 Below is a gallery with some pictures I took trhough ArduRover's development process. With the exception of the motor controller diagram in the middle of the third row ([source](https://askelectronics.co.ke/product/2-5a-dual-bridge-brushed-dc-motor-drive-controller-board-module-for-arduino-smart-car-robot-low-power-consumption-mx1919/)), I took/drew the remainder of the figures in the gallery.

#### 4c. Setbacks Encountered

 Somehow, I only encountered one major setback throughout the duration of this project (a huge win compared to what I expected). In November, I unfortunately fried the GPS shield I had purcahsed by providing too much voltage on accident from a plug-in power supply. This stalled my progress a bit since I was missing a functional GPS shield and probably contributed to my inability to get a fully-functioning navigation system up and running in time. Regardless, I was able to order a new GPS shield and am now using it to make progress on navigation software!

#### 4c. Upcoming Work

 Unfortunately, I was not able to built out autonomous driving capabilities prior to the end of the Fall 2022 semester. Even though I replaced the fried GPS shield and had all the required hardware on-hand, I simply ran out of time to implement and test the software necessary for GPS waypoint navigation. Over the coming weeks, I hope to finalize the navigation software necessary for this feature as the rest of my workload winds down.

## 5. Reflection

 Despite ArduRover not being able to autonomously navigate between GPS waypoints (yet), I am still incredibly happy with how this project turned out! In the end, I accomplished all of the personal goals outlined in 3b and every functional goal with the exception of autonomous navigation capabilities. Altogether, I was able to gain valuable skills and knowledge in working on electronics and robotics projects. Further, I was able to reasonably self-guide this project and set appropriate timelines in the context of my other academic commitments throughout the semester.

 Overall, I'm very happy with how the project turned out, and I intend to keep working on it for fun during my final semester at Pomona. Finally, I want to give a huge thank you to Prof. Clark for the guidance and advice throughout the semester!
