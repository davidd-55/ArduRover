# Activities

## Nav Code

In the interest of time and since this project is mainly to learn about hardware rather than software, I decided to base navigational code off of the code found in [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Powered-Autonomous-Vehicle/) that this project has been inspired by.

This code as-is can handle more sensors than this project has - it includes code for the use of GPS + compass data to help a small robot navigate waypoints. It *also* provides code to avoid objects with radar and output key statistics to an LCD display, whicb this project will not be including. Modified code that strips unnecessary features can be found in the [DemoCode/Nav_Example folder](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/tree/main/code/DemoCode/Nav_Example).

## Accidentally Blowing Stuff Up

I did the thing that is almost expected of someone playing with hardware for the first time: I blew something up.

While I was at home for Thanksgiving, I attempted to power the GPS shield independently with a wall-plugged power source to see which pin data was coming off of. Unfortunately, I did something dumb and plugged the GPS shield into the adjustable power source and turned the power on before checking what the power source had been most recently set to. It was 10V, and the GPS shield tops out at a 6V input. As a result, the GPS shield no longer powers on or outputs any data.

I've ordered a replacement that should come in on Friday 12/2. In the meantime, I've been working on trying to understand the nav code mentioned in the previous section.

# Plans

Main plans for the next two weeks include:

Hardware:
- *Actually* build out the platform
- Replace/re-solder GPS shield

Software:
- Keep modifying control sketch until the thing works!

# Issues/Questions

- Frying the GPS shield was a decent setback, but recoverable!
- I am a little concerned that other high-priority work (STS Senior Project paper, Algorithms final) might prevent me from getting a 100% working version of this project by the end of the semester.
- Is the second bullet okay?
