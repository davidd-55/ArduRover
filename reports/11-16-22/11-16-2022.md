## Motor Controller

The motor controller I purchased uses the MX1919 chip on a dual-motor controller board. There are two motors on the car, one for the RWD system (motor A) and one for the steering system (motor B), that this controller interfaces with.

The controller has IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4, and ground pins alongside a dedicated power supply. The original 3.6V batteries are being used as input power for the controller and thus the motors. The ground pin is connected to a ground pin on the Arduino Uno, and IN1/IN2 map to RWD motor A whereas IN3/IN4 map to steering motor B. A control scheme found by trial and error can be found in [this demo motor control sketch](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/blob/main/code/DemoCode/MotorDemo/MotorDemo.ino).

## Software & Reading Data

With the GPS shield and compass wired up in tandem, I wanted to sanity check that I could read data from both of them simultaneously. I set the Baud rate to 115200, switched the GPS unit over to "Soft Serial" mode, and wrote up some code to read data every two second from each sensor. That code can be found [here](https://github.com/davidd-55/ArduRover/blob/main/code/DemoCode/Combined_Example/Combined_Example.ino).

This code will pave the way for using the data from each sensor to actually drive motors!

# Plans

Main plans for the next two weeks include:

Hardware:
- Tidy up platform

Software:
- Create motor control sketch
- Try to create software for GPS driving; see how far I get
